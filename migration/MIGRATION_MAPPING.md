# Migration mapping: xettuyen2025_frontend → UI_HCMUE_XetTuyen

> Summary: copy missing components and services from `xettuyen2025_frontend` into `UI_HCMUE_XetTuyen`, convert JS → TSX/TS where needed, adapt imports and MUI/theme usage, and do NOT overwrite existing `sign-in` / `sign-up` views.

## Files to copy (high priority)

- src/components/auth/ComingSoon.js
  → src/sections/auth/view/coming-soon-view.tsx
  - Convert to TSX, adapt to UI theme and layout; add route only if needed.

- src/components/auth/LoginAdmin.js
  → src/sections/auth/view/login-admin-view.tsx
  - Admin-specific login (not present in UI). Convert and integrate with existing auth service.

## Services (merge / sync)

- src/services/auth.service.js (xettuyen)
  → src/services/authService.ts (UI)
  - Ensure register/login/logout endpoints and payloads match API; migrate helper functions.

- src/services/exam.service.js
  → src/services/examService.ts
  - Add missing helper methods found in xettuyen (getExamTicketsByUserAndExam, getExamResultSubjects, etc.)

- src/services/payment.service.js
  → src/services/paymentService.ts
  - Ensure payment return/notify endpoints and helpers are present.

- src/services/user.service.js
  → src/services/userService.ts
  - Add functions used by ReExamInfo / ReExamRegister components.

## Components already present in UI

- Admin views (board-admin, board-moderator, board-user, dashboard-exam, user-management, exam-management, exam-turn-management, exam-pay-management) — already present; will review and copy missing logic if any.

- Exam / Enrollment views (enrollment, enrollment-nn, exam-info, exam-paper, exam-results, reexam-register, reexam-info) — present; check for missing data fetching logic.

- Payment views — `payment-detail-view.tsx` and `payment-return-view.tsx` exist; prefer to keep UI versions.

## Duplicates / conflicts

- `PaymentReturn-1.js` exists in xettuyen; UI has `payment-return-view.tsx`. Skip copying duplicate; port any needed logic into existing UI view.

- `sign-in` & `sign-up` in xettuyen exist, but per requirement we will NOT overwrite UI's existing `sign-in-view` or `sign-up-view`.

## Conversion notes

- Convert `.js` → `.tsx` and add types where straightforward.
- Replace relative import paths to `src/...` using aliases in UI project.
- Replace local CSS or Bootstrap usage with MUI components / styles where practical.
- Add missing utility methods to `src/services/api.ts` (already present) for base URL and headers.

## Next steps

1. Copy `ComingSoon.js` and `LoginAdmin.js` into UI project, convert to TSX, wire to services. (DONE: created `src/sections/auth/coming-soon-view.tsx` and `src/sections/auth/login-admin-view.tsx`)
2. Register routes and exports (DONE: updated `src/routes/sections.tsx` and `src/sections/auth/index.ts`)
3. Merge missing helper functions from xettuyen services into UI `src/services/*`. (REVIEWED: most service methods already exist in UI; will merge any small differences on demand)
4. Run dev, fix types and runtime errors.
